### About Myself:
I'm 21 years old. I've been working in the service sector since I was 16, and I don't forget to study. 
During my work, I showed a lot of soft-skills: stress tolerance, purposefulness, teamwork, responsibility. 
Also 3 years ago I started studying photography and retouching in Photoshop. And as a result, I own it well. 
But I started the way to development quite recently: in May 2022.

I learn programming: with video courses and lectures, and of course through practice. I started with HTML, 
CSS - made up landing pages. I even made a couple of full one-page websites to order. I am eager to study further 
and become a real Frontend-developer.

In addition, I am quite a versatile person: I am interested in photography, cars, horse riding and drawing. I also like to read books.
